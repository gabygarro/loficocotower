# Scripts

First install

```
npm i
```

Local development

```
npm run dev
```

## Building the App

You may run `npm run build` command to build the app.

By default, the build output will be placed at dist. You may deploy this dist folder to any of your preferred platforms.

## Testing the App Locally

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.

The vite preview command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:3000. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
